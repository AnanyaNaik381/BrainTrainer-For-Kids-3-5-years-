🧠 Neural Pulse: Brain Trainer
A high-performance, browser-based cognitive training game designed to challenge logic, memory, and reaction speed.

🚀 Overview
Neural Pulse forces players to engage in rapid task-switching. Solve logic riddles under pressure to "stabilize" your mental state, then transition immediately into a spatial memory challenge.

🕹️ Features
Logic Gate: Randomly generated math and logic riddles with a countdown timer.

Emoji Memory: Visual-spatial recall using icons (🍎, 🚀, 💎) instead of simple shapes.

Adaptive Difficulty: * Level Scaling: Sequences get longer as you progress.

Penalty Mode: Failing a riddle makes the memory sequence flash at double speed.

Tech Stack: Built with pure HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla JavaScript (Zero dependencies).
